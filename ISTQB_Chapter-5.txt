Test Plan
release & Itration plan
entry(Definition of Ready[DoR]) and exit(definitaion of Done[DoD]) critiria
Test Estimation tech
	Matrics based estimation
		->Estimation based on Ration(take ref of completed project then estimate)
		-> Exrapolation(estimate based on burdown chart or ongoing sprint estmate estimate next sprint)
	Expert based estimation 
		->wide band delphi(sharing with team then estimate)
			planing pocker is number card and wide band delphi is isolated 
		->Three point estimation
				a + (4*m)+b
			E = -----------
					6
					a->most optimistic estimate
					m->most likely estimate
					b->most pessimestic Estimate
test execuition Schedule
How to do test case prioritation
	->Rise_based_Priorization(Hight risk excuted 1st but it will not work if High pri has dependnt on low prio then excute low prio 1st)
	->Coverage_base_Priozation(Most statement coverate execute 1st)
	->Requirement_based_Priozation(the test test by stakeholder is executed 1st)
Test Pyramid()
	-> Agle methologie more test conduct at the bottom of pyramid
	-> Treditional methode is complementory of age(like inverse pyramid)
	4 Quardarent(technology facing and bussiness facing)
		Q1-> techonology facing unit, unit integration test, test case are automated,CI/CD
		
		Q2-> bussiness facing support to the team,Functional testing , with acceptance crrteria can manual or automated
		
		Q3-> bussiness facing support to the team, User end testing like, Expolarotary testing and usability testing, user acceptance testing
		
		Q4-> techonology facing non-functional testing,smoke testing, critique the product
